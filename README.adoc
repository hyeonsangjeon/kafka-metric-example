= Vert.x Kafka Client examples

== Process Monitoring dashboard event push example
DashboardVerticle : Kafka consumer API to consume the metrics and send them to a monitoring dashboard Event Bus publish with websocket.

MetricsVerticle : example is assumed to be a kafka producer metrics in Json format.
.

```console
mvn clean package
java -jar ./target/kafka-examples-3.5.0-fat.jar
```
Run the `MainVerticle` main method and then open your browser at http://localhost:8080/

In real usage the Kafka broker would probably be managed externally and the `DashboardVerticle` /
`MetricsVerticle` executed separately with their own configuration.
